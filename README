============================
REMINDER: I don't have a patched libXft on my pc and the crash safeguard has been commented out. This means that my build may be prone to crashes when displaying emojis. (I haven't ecperienced any yet)

Axel's build of dwm
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.

Patch libXft for BGRA glyphs and scaling, otherwise crashes (Or uncomment iscol as a workaround so as not to use them).
This fix is currently under a merge request and can be found here https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxft/-/merge_requests/1#00577d0b8449c78bd852911e5ac5123234a9e957


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
